# Queue-TDD
CMPS 12B LAB 6 README for queue.c

implements a circular queue with dynamically allocated memory in C and uses unit tests to ensure it is working correctly.

use commands "make test", "make clean", and "make spotless" (without quotation marks)
from the command line to run the program.

make test compiles, executes the program, and shows the results of the unit tests
make clean deletes the compiled queue.o file with rm -f
make spotless deletes both the compiled queue.o file and the executable queue file

There are no known errors.
